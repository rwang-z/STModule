# STModule

&nbsp;

## Introduction

STModule is a computational method for exploring spatial structures of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data from the perspective of tissue modules - recurrent cellular communities spatially organized in tissues to exert specific biological functions.

For more details, please read the paper: **Exploring tissue modules revealed by spatially resolved transcriptomics with STModule**.
